## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Sneh Gupta, an Indian, who has just stepped into the Cyber World and is exploring more and more day by day!!
I regularly participate in CTFs and Hackathons to hone my skills in coding and cybersecurity.
I am attracted to **F**ree **O**pen **S**ource **S**oftwares and develop Command Line Interface based Tools and Applications.

Check out **MonTra**, a simple yet efficient CLI-Based Finance Tracker based on Python, in my GitHub Repositories. You may find a way to manage your finance effectively ;)
